## Admin workstation with RSAT, server manager, tools

## 🔹 Purpose

This Windows workstation is my primary admin console inside the homelab.  
From here I will:

- Run RSAT tools (AD Users & Computers, DNS, GPMC)
- Use Server Manager to manage `DC01` and other servers
- Connect to Proxmox, firewall, Security Onion, and Azure portals
- Test user experience inside the domain
